        Bono is a designer whose work focuses primarily on the interrelation
        between artistic and functional values within Garments and accessories.
        His visual language shows inspiration from nature, organisms and
        technical outdoor oriented designs. Having an active lifestyle, it is
        important that what he creates accompanies his work, his flow and his
        personality. At this moment, Bono is still working on finding the balance in combining artisan and technical values in his work.
